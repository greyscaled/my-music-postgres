# Music-postgres
As a DJ, I felt there was a need to create a local database to manage
my music.

As a developer, I'm used to spinning up and interacting with databases
using ORMs and advanced clients.

But in the spirit of C.S. Weekly [read about it here](https://medium.com/@vapurrmaid/code-something-weekly-how-and-why-44640d279ca1), I decided to do everything solely from command line with
the bash and the `psql` client for a few reasons.


## Installation
If you wish to use this program, make sure you have postgresql installed
in your system and in your path. You can always test if this is the case
by simply running one of the binaries included with the installation:

```bash
createdb
```
